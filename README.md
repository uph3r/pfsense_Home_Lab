# DNS over TLS (DoT) on pfSense 


This project provides a quick reference for configuring DNS over TLS (DoT) on your pfSense firewall to secure and encrypt your DNS lookups.

Enabling DoT prevents your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties from monitoring the websites you visit by forcing all DNS traffic to use a secure, encrypted connection on port 853.
